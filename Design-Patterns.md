## Maintainable Code

- Readable
- Consistent
- Predictable
- Looks like its written by the same person
- Documented


### The Strategy Pattern

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.


## Wisdom

> Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same

> Take what varies and "encapsulate" it so it won't affect the rest of your code. The result? Fewer consequences from code changes and more flexibility in your systems!

> Program to an interface, not an implementation.

> Exploit polymorphism by programming to a supertype so that the actual runtime object isn't locked into the code.

> Favor composition over inheritance.

# Big O

While Big O effectively describes both the best-and worst-case scenarios of a given algorithm, Big O Notation generally refers to worst-case scenario unless specified otherwise.

## O(1)
- Big Oh of 1 / order of 1
- The algorithm takes the same number of steps no matter how much data there is
- Constant time

## O(N)
- Oh of N
- For N elements, the algorithm would take N steps
- Linear time

## O(log N)
- Oh of log N
- Time complexity of _log_ time
- Algorithm that increases one step each time the data is doubled
- Binary search
